# python-training

My solutions to several Python exercises found on the web and on some books,
as well as experiments with databases, GUIs, etc..

## Subjects

- Python practicing in general
- Implementation of some algorithms
- Databases (backend)
- GUI (frontend)

## Warning

These are my first serious steps with Python so there most certainly are 
conceptual mistakes. All the stuff is compatible with Python 3.6.x.
