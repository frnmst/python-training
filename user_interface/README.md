## Kivy

Simple graphical user interfaces and games in Kivy.

## Installation

On Parabola GNU/Linux Libre, install:

    # pacman -S python-kivy

for Python 3.x.

Add permissions to access input devices:

    # gpasswd -a <username> input 

## Programs

- The `PocApp` class displays a couple of sliders, progress bars,
  and button widget that react to events such as pressing the buttons, moving 
  the sliders, turing on/off the switch, etc. It's just a proof of concept that 
  I will keep as a reference for serious programs written in Python 3 and Kivy.
  You will find some technical comments in the two files.
