# Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers
# that are overlapping. One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and
# the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.
# (If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that canâ€™t be divided by any other
# number. And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look
# it up on Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with an example, which I will
# describe below.)

# I have chosen the naive way. But you can also use sets:
# sp = set of the prime numbers
# sh = set of the happy numbers
# sc = sp U sh (intersection)
# You can also the following (also in list comprehensions):
#
# for p in primeslist
#   if p im happylist
#       duplicates.append(p)
#
# This method hash (possibly) a hidden for
# loop with the "if .. in .." construct.
# If the latter is true, the complexity is O(len(primeslist) * 
# len(happylist))

# Load the two lists

    while i < len(ordered_list) and len(ordered_list) > 1:
        if ordered_list[i-1] == ordered_list[i]:
            duplicates.append(ordered_list[i])
        i += 1

    return duplicates
