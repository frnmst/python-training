# Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that 
# contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.
# Extras: Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and 
# constructing a list, and another using sets.
# Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a 
# different function.
